# K-means-Clustering-Implementation
Implement the well-known clustering algorithm, K-means, based on a synthetic dataset cdata.csv.
This dataset contains two data columns, “X” and “Y”, and one “cluster” column (1, 2, 3, and 4). 

## Step
1. Randomly select data points as the initialized centroids. 
2. Calculate the new means to be the centroids of the observations in the new clusters.
3. Continue to do the step 1 until convergence.

## Value of Sum of Squared Error (SSE)
K-means clustering algorithm by changing K from low to high, the value of SSE will be like below
